# this shuffling algorithm allows the questions to be displayed
# in an order which doesn't repeat until absolutely necessary, 
# which is a nice feature because it's annoying when questions
# can repeat.

# However, this may be less of an issue with larger data sets 
# by virtue of being large data sets, but since the offline 
# cache sample probably isn't terribly large, it's nice to have
# this here. That said, it requires a knowwn number of questions
# and and runs in O(n) time, which is fairly quick considering 
# that the number of elements is unlikely to exceed a few tens
# of thousands.

# For basic benchmarking, running fisher_yates for 100,000 
# elements takes only 23 milliseconds, which is actually really
# quite good, since the full database even at this point is 
# only 40,000 questions in size. And storing that array of
# doubles would probably be 4MB, which isn't quite so good, but
# alas, it's okay.
