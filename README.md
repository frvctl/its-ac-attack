# A Trivia Database using Node.js, Express, and AngularJS


## General Overview of the Project

This will be the It's Academic Database of questions for practice
and pseudo-competitions between members. Currently I am planning 
for a fairly feature intensive application, the features that I 
intend to implement are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> Full Database of Quiz Bowl and It's Academic Questions and 
       answers that is queriable for reference or learning purposes
    </li>
    <li>
       Solo-Practice Mode where a user will be able to select a 
       category of questions or some other selective factor and then
           answer the questions.
      </li>
      <li> 
       Multi-player Mode - this is the big feature that will require a
         lot of work. Multi-player will inlude the following:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Ability to player against 2-10 other people </li>
        <li> Group mode where you can play 2-10vs2-10 others </li>
        <li> A Chat Room </li>
        <li> Score Keeping </li>
        <li> More, possibly </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
