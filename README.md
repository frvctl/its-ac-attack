# A Trivia Database using Node.js, Express, and SocketIO


## General Overview of the Project

This will be the It's Academic Database of questions for practice
and pseudo-competitions between members. Currently I am planning 
for a fairly feature intensive application, the features that I 
intend to implement are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> Full Database of Quiz Bowl and It's Academic Questions and 
       answers that is queriable for reference or learning purposes
    </li>
    <li>
       Solo-Practice Mode where a user will be able to select a 
       category of questions or some other selective factor and then
           answer the questions.
      </li>
      <li> 
       Multi-player Mode - this is the big feature that will require a
         lot of work. Multi-player will inlude the following:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Ability to player against 2-10 other people </li>
        <li> Group mode where you can play 2-10vs2-10 others </li>
        <li> A Chat Room </li>
        <li> Score Keeping </li>
        <li> More, possibly </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

## ToDo List

 * Different game settings ie 2v2 or free for all
 * Full gamification through a match search type feature
 * Fully functional vote system for deciding on things
 * Admin privalages for certain users
 * Fix the ugly black navbar and general design improvements
 * Single Player and Search functionality



## The Steps Beyond

Ultimatly this app is a real time gamified collaborative information dissemination enviroment in short a possibilty for the future of learning. Gamification makes almost everything more fun and more accessible to a wider audience therefor a way to learn almost anything in a gamified question/answer format would be somewhat revolutionary for learning. The way to this future is by taking information from web pages, say wikipedia, parsing them into trivia type questions and then playing against their friends and learning along the way. Not only could this be a powerful and less painful way to learn but the possibilties for what subjects and what knowledge could be gained is nearly endless. Although this is a long way off from this apps current state it is something that inspires me to continue working on it and hopefully get to that point in the future.
