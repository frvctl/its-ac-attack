# A Trivia Database using Node.js, Express, and AngularJS


## General Overview of the Project

This will be the It's Academic Database of questions for practice
and pseudo-competitions between members. Currently I am planning 
for a fairly feature intensive application, the features that I 
intend to implement are as follows:
	-- Full Database of Quiz Bowl and It's Academic Questions and 
		answers that is queriable for reference or learning purposes
	-- Solo-Practice Mode where a user will be able to select a 
		category of questions or some other selective factor and then
	    answer the questions. 
	-- Multi-player Mode - this is the big feature that will require a
		 lot of work. Multi-player will inlude the following:
		-- Ability to player against 2-10 other people
		-- Group mode where you can play 2-10vs2-10 others
		-- A Chat Room
		-- Score Keeping
		-- More, possibly

## TODO List:
	-- Establish an effective user authorization system
	-- Get all of the views and routes working properly
	-- Get the JSON of questions from Kevin and work on 
		the search function
	-- Create a suitable chat application as a standalone 
		application using Socket.io, Express, and Node
	-- Figure out what I am going to use for a server 
		and how to go about setting that up and using 
		it
